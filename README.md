# Demographic Data Analyzer

This project analyzes demographic data extracted from the 1994 Census database using Pandas. The analysis answers several specific questions about the dataset, such as the distribution of races, average age of men, education levels, income statistics, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is fetched from the UCI Machine Learning Repository using the `ucimlrepo` library. The dataset contains demographic information, including age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, race, sex, capital gain, capital loss, hours per week, native country, and salary.

## Analysis Questions

The following questions are answered by the analysis:

1. How many people of each race are represented in this dataset?
2. What is the average age of men?
3. What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
4. What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
5. What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
6. What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
7. What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
8. What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
9. Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.
